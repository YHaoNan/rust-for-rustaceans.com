This is original content:

> When reading about trait objects, you may see mentions of the trait bound Self: Sized.

Guess you wanna say, maybe ——

> When reading about trait types, you may see menthions of the trait bound Self: Sized.

The fifth word is changed to `types`. If this is not a mistake, can you help me to understand why you use `trait objects`?

Finally. This is an excellent book, and hope the Chinese version will come soon!
